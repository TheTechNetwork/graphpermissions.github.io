| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|id|GUID|The unique identifier for the **addIn** object.|
|properties|keyValue collection|The collection of key-value pairs that define parameters that the consuming service can use or call. You must specify this property when performing a POST or a PATCH operation on the **addIns** collection. Required.|
|type|string|The unique name for the functionality exposed by the app. |
### [apiApplication ](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/apiapplication?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|acceptMappedClaims| Boolean | When `true`, allows an application to use claims mapping without specifying a custom signing key. |
|knownClientApplications| Guid collection |Used for bundling consent if you have a solution that contains two parts: a client app and a custom web API app. If you set the appID of the client app to this value, the user only consents once to the client app. Microsoft Entra ID knows that consenting to the client means implicitly consenting to the web API and automatically provisions service principals for both APIs at the same time. Both the client and the web API app must be registered in the same tenant.|
|oauth2PermissionScopes| permissionScope collection | The definition of the delegated permissions exposed by the web API represented by this application registration. These delegated permissions may be requested by a client application, and may be granted by users or administrators during consent. Delegated permissions are sometimes referred to as OAuth 2.0 scopes. |
|preAuthorizedApplications| preAuthorizedApplication collection | Lists the client applications that are preauthorized with the specified delegated permissions to access this application's APIs. Users aren't required to consent to any preauthorized application (for the permissions specified). However, any other permissions not listed in preAuthorizedApplications (requested through incremental consent for example) will require user consent. |
|requestedAccessTokenVersion| Int32 | Specifies the access token version expected by this resource. This changes the version and format of the JWT produced independent of the endpoint or client used to request the access token. <br><br> The endpoint used, v1.0 or v2.0, is chosen by the client and only impacts the version of id_tokens. Resources need to explicitly configure **r
### [application ](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0&tabs=http)
| Property | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| addIns | addIn collection| Defines custom behavior that a consuming service can use to call an app in specific contexts.

| disabledByMicrosoftStatus | String | Specifies whether Microsoft has disabled the registered application. Possible values are: `null` (default value), `NotDisabled`, and `DisabledDueToViolationOfServicesAgreement` (reasons include suspicious, abusive, or malicious activity, or a violation of the Microsoft Services Agreement). <br><br> Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`). |
| displayName | String | The display name for the application. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, `in`, `startsWith`, and `eq` on `null` values), `$search`, and `$orderby`. |
| groupMembershipClaims | String | Configures the `groups` claim issued in a user or OAuth 2.0 access token that the application expects. To set this attribute, use one of the following valid string values: `None`, `SecurityGroup` (for security groups and Microsoft Entra roles), `All` (this gets all of the security groups, distribution groups, and Microsoft Entra directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of). |
| id | String | Unique identifier for the application object. This property is referred to as **Object ID** in the Microsoft Entra admin center. Inherited from directoryObject. Key. Not nullable. Read-only. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `in`).|
| identifierUris | String collection | Also known as App ID URI, this value is set when an application is used as a resource app. The identifierUris acts as the prefix for the scopes you reference in your API's code, and it must be globally unique. You can use the default value provided, which is in the form `api://<appId>`, or specify a more readable URI like `https://contoso.com/api`. For more information on valid identifierUris patterns and best practices, see Microsoft Entra application registration security best practices. Not nullable. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `ge`, `le`, `startsWith`).|
| info | informationalUrl | Basic profile information of the application such as  app's marketing, support, terms of service and privacy statement URLs.

For more info, see How to: Add Terms of service and privacy statement for registered Microsoft Entra apps. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `ne`, `not`, `ge`, `le`, and `eq` on `null` values). |
| isDeviceOnlyAuthSupported | Boolean | Specifies whether this application supports device authentication without a user. The default is `false`.  |
| isFallbackPublicClient | Boolean | Specifies the fallback application type as public client, such as an installed application running on a mobile device. The default value is `false`, which means the fallback application type is confidential client such as a web app. There are certain scenarios where Microsoft Entra ID can't determine the client application type. For example, the ROPC flow where it's configured without specifying a redirect URI. In those cases, Microsoft Entra ID interprets the application type based on the value of this property.|
| keyCredentials | keyCredential collection | The collection of key credentials associated with the application. Not nullable. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`). |
| logo | Stream | The main logo for the application. Not nullable. |

| requestSignatureVerification | requestSignatureVerification| Specifies whether this application requires Microsoft Entra ID to verify the signed authentication requests.|
| requiredResourceAccess |requiredResourceAccess collection| Specifies the resources that the application needs to access. This property also specifies the set of delegated permissions and application roles that it needs for each of those resources. This configuration of access to the required resources drives the consent experience. <br/><br/>No more than 50 resource services (APIs) can be configured. Beginning mid-October 2021, the total number of required permissions must not exceed 400. For more information, see Limits on requested permissions per app. Not nullable. <br><br>Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`, `ge`, `le`).|
| samlMetadataUrl | String | The URL where the service exposes SAML metadata for federation. This property is valid only for single-tenant applications. Nullable. |
| serviceManagementReference | String | References application or service contact information from a Service or Asset Management database. Nullable. |
| servicePrincipalLockConfiguration | servicePrincipalLockConfiguration | Specifies whether sensitive properties of a multitenant application should be locked for editing after the application is provisioned in a tenant. Nullable. `null` by default. |

|id|String|The unique identifier for the schema extension definition. <br>You can assign a value in one of two ways: <ul><li>Concatenate the name of one of your verified domains with a name for the schema extension to form a unique string in this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}. As an example, `contoso_mySchema`. </li><li>Provide a schema name, and let Microsoft Graph use that schema name to complete the **id** assignment in this format: ext\{_&#65279;8-random-alphanumeric-chars_\}\_\{_&#65279;schema-name_\}. An example would be `extkvbmkofy_mySchema`.</li></ul>This property cannot be changed after creation. Supports `$filter` (`eq`). **Note:** We recommend that your **id** starts with an alphabetic letter between A-Z because query capabilities might be limited for IDs that begin with integers. <br/><br/> Supports `$filter` (`eq`). |
|owner|String| The `appId` of the application that is the owner of the schema extension. The owner of the schema definition must be explicitly specified during the Create and Update operations, or it will be implied and auto-assigned by Microsoft Entra ID as follows: <br/><ul><li>In delegated access: <ul><li>The signed-in user must be the owner of the app that calls Microsoft Graph to create the schema extension definition. </li></ul> <ul><li>If the signed-in user isn't the owner of the calling app, they must explicitly specify the **owner** property, and assign it the **appId** of an app that they own.</li></ul></li></ul> <ul><li>In app-only access: <ul><li> The **owner** property isn't required in the request body. Instead, the calling app is assigned ownership of the schema extension.</li></ul></li></ul> </br>So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you **must** supply the owner property.
