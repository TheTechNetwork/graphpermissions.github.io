For details, see groups overview.<br><br>If the collection includes `DynamicMembership`, the group has dynamic membership; otherwise, membership is static. <br><br>Returned by default. Supports `$filter` (`eq`, `not`). |
| hasMembersWithLicenseErrors | Boolean | Indicates whether there are members in this group that have license errors from its group-based license assignment. <br><br>This property is never returned on a GET operation.

| isArchived | Boolean | When a group is associated with a team, this property determines whether the team is in read-only mode.<br/>To read this property, use the `/group/{groupId}/team` endpoint or the Get team API. To update this property, use the archiveTeam and unarchiveTeam APIs. |
| isAssignableToRole | Boolean | Indicates whether this group can be assigned to a Microsoft Entra role. Optional. <br><br>This property can only be set while creating the group and is immutable. If set to `true`, the **securityEnabled** property must also be set to `true`, **visibility** must be `Hidden`, and the group can't be a dynamic group (that is, **groupTypes** can't contain `DynamicMembership`). <br/><br/>Only callers with at least the Privileged Role Administrator role can set this property. The caller must also be assigned the _RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory_ permission to set this property or update the membership of such groups.
