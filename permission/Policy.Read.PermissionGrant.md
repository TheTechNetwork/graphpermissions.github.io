Service principals representing managed identities can be granted access and permissions, but can't be updated or modified directly.</li><li>__Legacy__ - A service principal that represents an app created before app registrations, or through legacy experiences. A legacy service principal can have credentials, service principal names, reply URLs, and other properties that are editable by an authorized user, but doesn't have an associated app registration. The **appId** value doesn't associate the service principal with an app registration. The service principal can only be used in the tenant where it was created.</li><li>__SocialIdp__ - For internal use. </ul>|
