If the associated app registration is missing, tokens aren't issued for the service principal.</li><li>__ManagedIdentity__ - A service principal that represents a managed identity. Service principals representing managed identities can be granted access and permissions, but can't be updated or modified directly.</li><li>__Legacy__ - A service principal that represents an app created before app registrations, or through legacy experiences. A legacy service principal can have credentials, service principal names, reply URLs, and other properties that are editable by an authorized user, but doesn't have an associated app registration. The **appId** value doesn't associate the service principal with an app registration. The service principal can only be used in the tenant where it was created.</li><li>__SocialIdp__ - For internal use. </ul>|
| signInAudience | String | Specifies the Microsoft accounts that are supported for the current application. Read-only. <br><br>Supported values are:<ul><li>`AzureADMyOrg`: Users with a Microsoft work or school account in my organization's Microsoft Entra tenant (single-tenant).</li><li>`AzureADMultipleOrgs`: Users with a Microsoft work or school account in any organization's Microsoft Entra tenant (multitenant).</li><li>`AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount`: Users with a personal Microsoft account, or a work or school account in any organization's Microsoft Entra tenant.</li><li>`PersonalMicrosoftAccount`: Users with a personal Microsoft account only.</li></ul> |

| tokenEncryptionKeyId |String|Specifies the keyId of a public key from the keyCredentials collection. When configured, Microsoft Entra ID issues tokens for this application encrypted using the key specified by this property. The application code that receives the encrypted token must use the matching private key to decrypt the token before it can be used for the signed-in user.|
| verifiedPublisher          | verifiedPublisher                            | Specifies the verified publisher of the application that's linked to this service principal.
